## Getting Started

Please just use NPM, and NPX, yarn has some issues.

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```
If you have both, yarn and npm, and are creating a new next app, for whatever reason
```
npx create-next-app <app-name> --use-npm
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
